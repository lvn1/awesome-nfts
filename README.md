# üöÄ Absolutely Awesome NFTs

This is a list of AWESOME NFTs. Nope, it's NOT a comprehensive list of
every NFT under the sun. So, what does "awesome" mean? Well:

- It solves a real problem
- It does so in a ü¶Ñ unique, ü¶ã beautiful, or üèÜ exceptional way. (And it's not super popular and well-known... no point in listing those.)
- It has recent code commits!

### Contributing

Please review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We keep this list fresh by **requiring all PRs to remove one or more non-awesome entries from this list**. Please ONLY PR a new resource if you are ALSO removing one.
